[00:10.74] Not a lie and not the truth
[00:13.52] Out of line and out a few
[00:16.37] Hundred dollars and I lost a tooth
[00:19.01] Out of gas but a hundred proof
[00:34.01] 
[00:20.93] And I slurred what I came to say
[00:23.62] And the words took half a day
[00:26.33] Dozed off and missed my turn
[00:29.01] Came to with time to burn
[00:41.51] 
[00:30.94] You said, "I'm just in it for the ride."
[00:50.94] 
[00:35.49] ()
[00:36.40] Well, Good Job
[00:38.28] When it goes down I'll lift up my hands
[00:40.98] And say
[00:42.85] "I got everything I wanted anyway!"
[00:46.44] Take off
[00:48.39] Hit the ground running
[00:49.24] Make haste to the bed we've made up
[00:51.91] "I got everything I wanted anyway!"
[01:09.41] 
[00:57.49] Stretch an hour into a week
[01:00.15] Excuse for another me
[01:02.82] Found a wall to lean into
[01:04.72] To the nines when destitute
[01:18.22] 
[01:07.45] 24 and half were asleep
[01:10.29] Raise the bar till it measures me
[01:12.94] Can't stop till I'm out of reach
[01:14.78] Too many people want a drink of me
[01:31.78] 
[01:17.54] You say "I'm just in it for the ride."
[01:36.54] 
[01:22.14] ()
[01:23.09] Well, Good Job
[01:24.89] When it goes down I'll lift up my hands
[01:27.55] And say
[01:28.54] "I got everything I wanted anyway!"
[01:33.01] Take off
[01:34.83] Hit the ground running
[01:35.76] Make haste to the bed we've made up
[01:38.55] "I got everything I wanted anyway!"
[01:56.05] 
[02:03.35] But when I'm up, up, up
[02:06.60] I'm always waiting (Yeah)
[02:12.16] And when I'm down, down, down
[02:18.50] Feed it to me (To Me!)
[02:24.09] And I don't wanna peel myself back
[02:41.09]

[02:46.06] "I got everything I wanted anyway!"
[03:03.56] 
[02:51.61] 6x (When it goes down I'll hit the ground running)
[03:16.61] 
[03:07.26] "I got everything I wanted anyway!"
