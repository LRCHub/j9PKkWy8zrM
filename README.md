> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I I need a break from work
Gotta go and mend my broken heart
I need a break from love
Gotta go and figure out myself
This world's a messed-up place,
So don't you dare get lost in it oh yeah
I need to cleanse my brain
Gotta go forget my wounded past
VACATION
Gotta buy me a ticket to LA
This world's a F-ed up place,
But don't you lose your hope in it, okay?
I don't need no teacher
I don't need no phone
I don't need a lover
To keep me feeling great you know
I don't need girl drama
I don't need a cat
I don't need no number
To keep me feeling great you know
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD x2
I'm feelin' GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD
Fake it till you make it girls
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD x2
I'm feelin' GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD
Sing along oh "Dancing Boy"
NAH NAH NAH… "Good Job!"
I need to save some room
Gotta go throw out procrastination
I need to say good-bye
Don't need your stupid validation
This world's a messed up place
Astala-Vista baby! oh yeah
Give me love, give me time,
I'm about to decide what to compromise,
What to choose and deny
Looking at the mirror and practicing my smile
You might fall in love with the latest version
of you
But don't forget to remember your roots?
So don't make a fuss and give it a go
Better be cool, gotta be cool,
Takin' a good look inside my broken heart
I don't need no teacher
I don't need no phone
I don't need a lover
To keep me feeling great you know
I don't need permission
I don't need no filter
I kind of want a Lotus
I'm feeling good 気分は最高
I don't need a lot of money
I just need so much
To keep my belly happy
To keep me feeling great you know
I just need some music
And a good night's sleep
I'm not sad or lonely
I'm feeling good, cuz life is short
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD x2
I'm feelin' GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD
Fake it 'till you make it girls
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD x2
I'm feelin' GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD
Sing along and make some noise
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD x2
Now sing it! GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD
Fake it 'till you make it boys
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD x2
Everybody! GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD
Feeling good will save our lives
NAH NAH NAH… "Good Job!"
